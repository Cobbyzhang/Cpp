This is Cobby Zhang's text
Please take care of it and never add any comma or other character which is not aalphabet
This text consists of only six lines of words 
It is just for test so it is very simple
I would do more job to improve this program to make it be able to deal with initial word and some other character such as comma
But the initial version only copy the code in text book C++ primer
